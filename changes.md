### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Fixed job triggers, gosec installation, and path-based workflow execution

### Changes Made

**Job Trigger Fixes:**
- Removed invalid `if: contains(github.event.head_commit.modified, ...)` conditions from all jobs
- Added proper `paths` filters to workflow triggers for push and pull_request events
- Now triggers only when files in `cyber-dashboard/`, `fastapi/`, `gin-api/`, or `.github/workflows/` change

**Gosec Installation Fix:**
- Changed installation to use `/usr/local/bin` with `sudo` for proper permissions
- Added verification steps (`which gosec`, `gosec --version`) for debugging
- Simplified to direct `gosec ./...` execution after installation

**Docker Push Logic:**
- Existing Docker login/push conditions work correctly: `if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`
- Jobs will now actually run on main branch pushes (fixing the trigger issue)

### Reasoning
- `github.event.head_commit.modified` doesn't exist in GitHub Actions context
- Path-based triggers are more efficient and only run jobs when relevant files change
- `/usr/local/bin` is in PATH by default, eliminating PATH issues
- Verification steps help debug installation problems
- Removing invalid job conditions allows jobs to run when they should
