### 20:00 - Added .gitignore and .dockerignore Files

**Summary:** Created comprehensive .gitignore and .dockerignore files for all three services (Next.js frontend, Go API, FastAPI)

**Files Created:**
- `gin-api/.gitignore` - New gitignore for Go API with Go-specific patterns
- `gin-api/.dockerignore` - New Docker ignore file for Go API

## 2025-08-05 [Current Session - 20:30]

### Fixed TypeScript/ESLint Build Errors

**Summary**: Fixed all TypeScript and ESLint errors that were preventing the Docker build from succeeding.

**Files Modified**:
- `cyber-dashboard/app/calendar/page.tsx`
- `cyber-dashboard/app/containers/page.tsx`
- `cyber-dashboard/components/social-feed-widget.tsx`
- `cyber-dashboard/components/weather-widget.tsx`

**Changes Made**:

**Calendar Page (`app/calendar/page.tsx`)**:
- Removed unused variable `startTime` by using underscore prefix: `const [, setStartTime]`
- Removed unused function `addTodo` (kept `addTodoWithNotification` which is actually used)
- Removed unused function `switchTimerType`
- Fixed `any` type in category select to proper union type: `'meeting' | 'reminder' | 'deadline' | 'personal'`

**Containers Page (`app/containers/page.tsx`)**:
- Removed unused state variables: `setSelectedNodeResource`, `setCpuAllocation`, `setMemoryAllocation`, `setDiskAllocation`, `setShowNetworkingOptions`
- Removed unused constants: `nodes`, `networkingOptions`, `storageOptions`
- Removed unused functions: `handleAllocateResources`, `handleInstallNetworking`
- Fixed unescaped quotes in JSX: `"Show logs"` → `&quot;Show logs&quot;`

**Social Feed Widget (`components/social-feed-widget.tsx`)**:
- Fixed `any` type in filter select to proper union type: `"all" | "security" | "tech" | "devops"`
- Added `useCallback` hook import
- Wrapped `fetchFeedData` function with `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added `filter` dependency to `useCallback` dependency array
- Updated `useEffect` dependency array to only include `fetchFeedData`

**Weather Widget (`components/weather-widget.tsx`)**:
- Fixed unescaped apostrophe in JSX: `Today's` → `Today&apos;s`

**Reasoning**: These changes were necessary to fix the Docker build failure. The errors were preventing successful compilation and deployment. All unused code was removed to maintain clean code standards, and proper TypeScript types were used instead of `any` for better type safety.

**Impact**: 
- Docker build now succeeds without errors
- Improved code quality and type safety
- Removed dead code that could cause confusion
- Better React performance with proper `useCallback` usage
- ESLint warnings resolved, maintaining code quality standards

**Build Status**: ✅ All tests pass, no TypeScript or ESLint errors
