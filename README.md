# k8s-dashboard

Welcome to my personal internet dashboard for managing and automating my `Kubernetes` home server. When I open this app I get a friendly snapshot of everything I need to tackle today, from container health to quick links for my most-used services. Think of it as the launchpad for my `DevSecOps` playground.

## Key features

1. **Home view**  
    A clear overview of your `Kubernetes` cluster: how many pods are running, which ones need attention, and basic resource metrics. All displayed with a clean interface so you know at a glance if everything’s doing fine.

2. **Services grid**  
    • Pi-hole `DNS` manager to keep your network ads under control  
    • `WireGuard` `VPN` panel the only way in
    • `pgAdmin` dashboard for database tasks  
    • `Grafana` and Prometheus widgets for deeper metric exploration  
    • My own `Minecraft` server status right on the grid  
    • Node switcher for jumping between cluster nodes without extra clicks  
    • Quick-access links to your favorite web tools



3. **Containers page**  
    Right now it lists running containers, images, and basic logs. Soon I’ll add a Docker Desktop–style view complete with buttons to restart containers, update images, back up volumes, clean up old data, and show advanced stats. (planned)

4. **Terminal & SSH**  
    One-click terminal scripts let me run my go-based automation tools. Next to it is an SSH tab for instant access to any node no extra command-line gymnastics. (planned)

5. **Chatbot corner**  
    I’m cooking up an AI agent that can answer questions about my infrastructure or even help me troubleshoot issues on the fly. (planned)

## What’s coming next (planned)

1. **Security page**  
    One button to run Ansible playbooks that harden your nodes or test your container defenses. Perfect for a quick pentest or compliance check.

2. **Calendar & focus tools**  
    An integrated calendar to track tasks and deadlines, plus a built-in to-do list, focus timer, and stopwatch. All the productivity gadgets you need to stay on track, without leaving your dashboard.

3. **Social feed & weather widget**  
    A mini-RSS reader for articles I follow, showing headline stats. And a weather panel so I know if I need an umbrella before I head out.
